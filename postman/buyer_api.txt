Postman Setup Instructions:
Create Environment Variables:

base_url: http://localhost:8080 (or your server URL)

jwt_token: Your authentication token

buyer_id: The ID of an existing buyer

Authentication:
First, you need to authenticate and get a JWT token from your auth endpoints, then use it in the Authorization header.

Testing Sequence:

Start with creating a buyer profile

Then test GET endpoints

Update the profile

Finally, test delete (if needed)

Sample Valid Business Types:
retailer

wholesaler

exporter

processor

restaurant

supermarket

Sample Valid Business Scales:
small

medium

large

enterprise

Make sure your JWT token has the appropriate roles (especially for admin endpoints like verification) and that the user ID in the token matches the buyer profile you're trying to modify.
